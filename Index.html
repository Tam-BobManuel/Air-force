                    <li>The actual process of joining the Air Force is fairly simple, and you’ll be guided by your recruiter every step of the way. Before you can be accepted, there are mandatory requirements and evaluations that you must pass to ensure you have what it takes to succeed as an Airman in the Nigerian Air Force.</li>

                    <h1>APTITUDE TESTING</h1>
                    <span>Before enlisting, you must take the Armed Forces Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB) test, which covers four areas critical to the Air Force mission: arithmetic reasoning, work knowledge, paragraph comprehension and mathematics knowledge. This test helps determine whether you have the mental aptitude to withstand the demands of the Air Force and identifies your strengths to determine the careers best suited for your future success.</span>

                    <span>Once you’ve passed all the necessary requirements and tests and have been officially accepted into the Air Force, you’ll go into the Delayed Entry Program (DEP), which means you’re waiting for your departure date for Basic Military Training (BMT). During this time, it’s a good idea to work on your physical conditioning to prepare for the challenges of BMT.</span>

                    <h1>PHYSICAL AND MENTAL SCREENING</h1>
                    <span>Once you have taken the ASVAB, your recruiter will make an appointment for you at a nearby Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS) to assess your physical and moral standards as set by the Air Force, the Department of Defense and federal law. When processing through MEPS, you’ll provide your jobs counselor with a list of every job and aptitude area you are qualified for and willing to train for as your Air Force career. Depending on our current needs, you will either receive one of the jobs you expressed interest in or one that best serves your strengths and our mission.</span>
